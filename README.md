# RE:Cards
This is an open-source web application to study and manage flashcards.
You can view the deployed version [here](https://card.redmike.me).

### Status
This app is in active development and is not at a release stage yet. Use at
your own risk.

### Why
I wanted to get more experience with React and Google Firebase, as well as look into
PWAs (Progressive Web Apps). I decided to develop a PWA that will help students like me
to organize and study flashcards with the help of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) 
algorithm. 

### Technologies used
- Frontend:
    - [React (v16, hooks)](https://reactjs.org/)
    - [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
    - [PWA spec, service workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications)
- Backend:
    - [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/)
    - [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/)
- DevOps:
    - [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
